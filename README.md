<h2>A Bit About Me</h2>
<p>Hi! My name is Ashley and one of my hobby is to travel to other countries and very much regret about going there and swear to myself never to go outside of a First World country, but end up going back again...It's sort of an addiction for me to travel.</p>
<p>Anyways, visiting different places and experiencing a whole new culture, lifestyle, especially being out of your comfort zone, can turn out to be a not so pleasant at times. I have first hand experience of those...However, those experiences are valuable; They shape you, they wire your brain so you can be more accepting of differences, and they allow you to recognize and appreciate the true value of the things around you.</p> 

<h2>How boxing shapes me as a person
</h2>
<p>I must admit I have a love and hate relationship with boxing. First of all, I hate sprints. I love staying at home, sleeping, and eating sweets all day. Don't we all? But somehow I ended up getting myself punched in the face, bleeding, and cursing myself for getting involved in this intense sport. I tried to quit many times - belive me - I did. But everytime I tried to quit, something always kept me aboard - teamates, coaches, and myself. </p>
